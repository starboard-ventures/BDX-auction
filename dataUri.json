    "data_description": "The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is sourced by Global System Laboratory from National Oceanic && Atmospheric Administration. It is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh. \n\nhttps://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-large-datasets/issues/1146",
